# Kubernetes deployment manifest for the "Let's Encrypt" Production issuer.
#
# This is standard boilerplate for any application that has ingress protected by
# Let's Encrypt SSL/TLS certificates. To increase application portability, this
# is defined as an Issuer rather than a ClusterIssuer, which avoids a
# requirement that every cluster must name this Issuer the same.
