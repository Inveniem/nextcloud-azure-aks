## Reporting a Vulnerability
Please do not report vulnerabilities using the issue queue. Instead, please 
email sysadmins at inveniem dot com if you believe you have found a
vulnerability in the way that our Docker images are packaged or configured. 

If you believe you have found a vulnerability in Nextcloud itself, please do not report
your issue to us. Instead, report it through Nextcloud's own system at
https://hackerone.com/nextcloud.

We will respond to any vulnerability reported within 48 hours. Our response will provide an
update on how quickly we believe we can commit to fixing the issue you have reported.
